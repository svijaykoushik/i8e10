## 🧐 What’s in a name?


The name i8·e10 is a contraction of Income 8 and Expense 10. It is a modern nod to the classic Tamil song lyrics:

> வரவு எட்டணா,
> செலவு பத்தனா;
> அதிகம் இரண்டனா
> கடைசியில் துண்டனா

*(Income is 8 annas, Expense is 10 annas; The extra 2 annas lead to a deficit in the end.)*

The app serves as a tool to help you track that very balance and ensure your "expense" never overtakes your "income"

## 🚀 Production Setup

i8·e10 is a static web application and requires no backend. You can host it easily on any static hosting provider (like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) or run it on your own server.

1.  **Download the files:** Get the latest version of release containing the built project.
2.  **Serve the directory:** Use any static file server to serve the root directory containing `index.html`.

Here's a quick way to run it locally using `npx`:

```bash
# Make sure you are in the project's root directory
npx serve .
```

Now you can access the application at the URL provided by the command (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

### Docker

You can also run i8e10 using Docker:

1.  **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t i8e10 .
    ```
2.  **Run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:80 i8e10
    ```
3.  **Using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory to define these variables locally during development.

3.  **Run the Development Server**

    This project is set up to run with a simple static server, as all modules are handled by the browser via import maps.
